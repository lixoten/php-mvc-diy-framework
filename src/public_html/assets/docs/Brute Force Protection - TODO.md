# Brute Force Protection - Status & Implementation Plan

## **1. Login Brute Force Protection**
This is the most common and critical area for brute force protection, as login attempts are a primary target for attackers.

### **Key Features**:
- **Per-User Lockout**:
  - Lock a specific user account after a certain number of failed login attempts.
- **IP-Based Lockout**:
  - Block login attempts from an IP address after too many failures across any accounts.
- **Sliding Window**:
  - Count failed attempts within a specific time window (e.g., 15 minutes).
- **Reset on Success**:
  - Clear failed attempts for a user after a successful login.
- **CAPTCHA Integration**:
  - Display CAPTCHA after multiple failed attempts.

### **Current Status**:
- **‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED**:
  - Per-user lockout
  - IP-based lockout
  - Sliding window logic
  - Reset on success
  - CAPTCHA integration after multiple failures
- **üîÑ TODO**:
  - Add progressive delays (e.g., increasing wait time after each failure)

## **2. Password Reset Brute Force Protection**
Attackers may try to abuse the password reset functionality to gain unauthorized access or overwhelm the system.

### **Key Features**:
- **Rate Limiting**:
  - Limit the number of password reset requests per user or IP address.
- **Token Expiry**:
  - Ensure reset tokens expire after a short period.
- **IP-Based Restrictions**:
  - Block requests from suspicious IP addresses.

### **Current Status**:
- **‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED**:
  - Token expiry logic (fully implemented in `User` entity using integer timestamps)
- **üîÑ TODO**:
  - Implement rate limiting for password reset requests
  - Log and monitor password reset requests

---

## **3. Registration Brute Force Protection**
Attackers may try to abuse the registration process to create fake accounts or overwhelm the system.

### **Key Features**:
- **Rate Limiting**:
  - Limit the number of registration attempts per IP address.
- **CAPTCHA**:
  - Add CAPTCHA to prevent automated registrations.
- **Email Verification**:
  - Require email verification to activate accounts.

### **Current Status**:
- **‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED**:
  - Email verification
  - CAPTCHA integration on registration form
- **üîÑ TODO**:
  - Add rate limiting for registration attempts

---

## **4. API Brute Force Protection**
If your application exposes APIs, they can also be a target for brute force attacks.

### **Key Features**:
- **Rate Limiting**:
  - Limit the number of API requests per IP address or API key.
- **JWT Token Abuse Prevention**:
  - Detect and block repeated invalid token usage.
- **IP Whitelisting**:
  - Allow only trusted IPs to access sensitive endpoints.

### **Current Status**:
- **üîÑ TODO**:
  - Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
  - Add logging and monitoring for API requests
  - Implement JWT token abuse prevention

---

## **5. Administrative Actions Brute Force Protection**
Administrative actions, such as login attempts to the admin panel or clearing login attempts, can also be targeted.

### **Key Features**:
- **Admin Login Protection**:
  - Apply stricter brute force protection for admin accounts.
- **Audit Logging**:
  - Log all administrative actions for review.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**:
  - Require 2FA for admin accounts.

### **Current Status**:
- **üîÑ TODO**:
  - Add stricter brute force protection for admin accounts
  - Implement audit logging for admin actions
  - Implement 2FA for admin accounts

---

## **Implementation Priority**
1. **üî• HIGH**: Complete login protection with progressive delays
2. **üî• HIGH**: Extend rate limiting to password reset functionality
3. **‚ö° MEDIUM**: Implement rate limiting for registration
4. **‚ö†Ô∏è NORMAL**: Add API protection features
5. **‚ö†Ô∏è NORMAL**: Implement admin protection features

---

## **How to Approach This**
1. **Use Shared Components**:
   - Leverage the existing rate limiting middleware for password reset and registration
   - Extend the CAPTCHA system to additional forms as needed

2. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update this document as features are implemented
   - Create unit tests for each new protection feature

3. **Code Review Guidelines**:
   - Ensure no security bypass possibilities
   - Check for proper error handling
   - Verify rate limit configuration is appropriate for each endpoint

4. **Next Actions**:
   - Implement progressive delays in the BruteForceProtectionService
   - Add rate limiting configuration for password reset endpoints
   - Create abuse monitoring and reporting dashboard
