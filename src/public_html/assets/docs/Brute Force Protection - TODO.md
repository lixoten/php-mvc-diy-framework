## **1. Login Brute Force Protection**
This is the most common and critical area for brute force protection, as login attempts are a primary target for attackers.

### **Key Features**:
- **Per-User Lockout**:
  - Lock a specific user account after a certain number of failed login attempts.
- **IP-Based Lockout**:
  - Block login attempts from an IP address after too many failures across any accounts.
- **Sliding Window**:
  - Count failed attempts within a specific time window (e.g., 15 minutes).
- **Reset on Success**:
  - Clear failed attempts for a user after a successful login.

### **Current Status**:
- **Implemented**:
  - Per-user lockout.
  - IP-based lockout.
  - Sliding window logic.
  - Reset on success.
- **TODO**:
  - Add progressive delays (e.g., increasing wait time after each failure).
  - Add CAPTCHA after multiple failures.

## **2. Password Reset Brute Force Protection**
Attackers may try to abuse the password reset functionality to gain unauthorized access or overwhelm the system.

### **Key Features**:
- **Rate Limiting**:
  - Limit the number of password reset requests per user or IP address.
- **Token Expiry**:
  - Ensure reset tokens expire after a short period (e.g., 15 minutes).
- **IP-Based Restrictions**:
  - Block requests from suspicious IP addresses.

### **Current Status**:
- **TODO**:
  - Implement rate limiting for password reset requests.
  - Add token expiry logic (partially implemented in `User` entity).
  - Log and monitor password reset requests.

## **3. Registration Brute Force Protection**
Attackers may try to abuse the registration process to create fake accounts or overwhelm the system.

### **Key Features**:
- **Rate Limiting**:
  - Limit the number of registration attempts per IP address.
- **CAPTCHA**:
  - Add CAPTCHA to prevent automated registrations.
- **Email Verification**:
  - Require email verification to activate accounts.

### **Current Status**:
- **Implemented**:
  - Email verification.
- **TODO**:
  - Add rate limiting for registration attempts.
  - Add CAPTCHA to the registration form.

## **4. API Brute Force Protection**
If your application exposes APIs, they can also be a target for brute force attacks.

### **Key Features**:
- **Rate Limiting**:
  - Limit the number of API requests per IP address or API key.
- **JWT Token Abuse Prevention**:
  - Detect and block repeated invalid token usage.
- **IP Whitelisting**:
  - Allow only trusted IPs to access sensitive endpoints.

### **Current Status**:
- **TODO**:
  - Implement rate limiting for API endpoints.
  - Add logging and monitoring for API requests.

---

## **5. Administrative Actions Brute Force Protection**
Administrative actions, such as login attempts to the admin panel or clearing login attempts, can also be targeted.

### **Key Features**:
- **Admin Login Protection**:
  - Apply stricter brute force protection for admin accounts.
- **Audit Logging**:
  - Log all administrative actions for review.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**:
  - Require 2FA for admin accounts.

### **Current Status**:
- **TODO**:
  - Add stricter brute force protection for admin accounts.
  - Implement 2FA for admin accounts.

## **How to Approach This**
1. **Prioritize Login Brute Force Protection**:
   - This is the most critical area and already partially implemented. Focus on completing it first.

2. **Tackle One Area at a Time**:
   - After login protection, move on to password reset, then registration, and so on.

3. **Use Shared Components**:
   - Reuse components like rate limiting and IP-based restrictions across different areas.

4. **Document Each Area Separately**:
   - Create separate documents for each area (e.g., "Login Brute Force Protection," "Password Reset Brute Force Protection") to keep things organized.

---

## **Next Steps**
- **For Login Brute Force Protection**:
  - Review the current implementation to ensure it meets all requirements.
  - Add progressive delays and CAPTCHA as planned enhancements.

- **For Other Areas**:
  - Start with password reset protection, as it’s closely related to login.
  - Document the current status and plan for each area.
