## Part 3: Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Jars and Fruit

1.  **Clean the Jars:** Wash your jars and rings in hot, soapy water. Rinse well. Keep the jars warm in an oven set to 200Â°F or a dishwasher on a hot cycle until ready to use. Do not boil the flat lids; just keep them clean.
2.  **Prepare Your "Canner":** Place your clean pot on the stove with the rack or trivet at the bottom. Fill the pot halfway with water and bring it to a simmer. You will use this to process the jars later.
3.  **Prepare the Fruit:** Place the peeled prickly pears into a large, heavy-bottomed pot. Use a potato masher or an immersion blender to break down the fruit.
4.  **Strain the Seeds:** Carefully strain the fruit pulp to remove all the seeds. A food mill is most efficient, but a fine-mesh strainer with a spatula to press the pulp will also work. You should have about 4-5 cups of strained juice and pulp.

### Step 2: Cook the Jam

1.  **Combine and Start the Boil:** Pour the strained prickly pear pulp/juice and the lemon juice into the large, clean pot. Whisk in the entire box of powdered pectin until it's completely dissolved.
2.  **Add Sugar:** Bring the mixture to a full, rolling boil that you cannot stir down. Once it reaches this point, add all the sugar at once and the optional 1/4 teaspoon of butter.
3.  **Final Boil:** Stir constantly to dissolve the sugar. Return the mixture to a full, rolling boil and time it for exactly **1 minute**. Keep stirring to prevent scorching.
4.  **Check for Set:** (Optional but recommended) Spoon a small amount of jam onto a plate you've chilled in the freezer. Let it cool for about a minute. If it wrinkles when you push it with your finger, it's ready. If not, boil for another minute and re-test.

### Step 3: Fill Jars and Process

1.  **Fill the Jars:** Carefully remove your warm jars from the oven or dishwasher. Using a funnel and ladle, fill each jar, leaving a 1/4-inch headspace at the top.
2.  **Clean and Secure:** Use a clean, damp cloth to wipe the rim of each jar. Place a new, clean lid on top and screw on the ring until it is "fingertip tight" (snug but not overtightened).
3.  **Process the Jars:** Place the filled jars onto the rack in your simmering "canner" pot. Ensure the jars are not touching each other and are covered by at least 1-2 inches of water.
4.  **Time the Process:** Place the lid on the pot and bring the water to a full, rolling boil. Start your timer and process the jars for **10 minutes**. (Add 5 minutes for every 1,000 feet of elevation above sea level).
5.  **Cool Down:** After the processing time, turn off the heat and let the jars sit in the hot water for 5 minutes.
6.  **Cool Completely:** Using your jar lifter, carefully remove the jars and place them on a towel-lined counter or a cooling rack. Let them sit undisturbed for 12-24 hours. You should hear a "ping" sound as the lids seal.

### Step 4: Storage

1.  **Check Seals:** After 12-24 hours, press on the center of each lid. If the lid is concave and does not pop up, it is properly sealed.
2.  **Label and Store:** Label your jars with the name and date. Store them in a cool, dark place for up to one year. Any unsealed jars should be refrigerated and used within a few weeks.
