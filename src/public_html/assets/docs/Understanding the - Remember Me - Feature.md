# Understanding the "Remember Me" Feature

The "Remember Me" feature allows users to remain logged in even after closing their browser or restarting their device. Here's how it works and how to test it:

## How "Remember Me" Works:

1. **When User Logs In with "Remember Me" checked:**
   - Generate a secure, random token
   - Store this token in database with user ID and expiration date (typically 2 weeks or 30 days)
   - Send the token to the user in a secure, HTTP-only cookie with long expiration

2. **On Subsequent Visits:**
   - If no active session exists, check for the remember me cookie
   - If cookie exists, validate the token against database
   - If valid, automatically log the user in (create new session)
   - Optionally, rotate the token for enhanced security

3. **Security Measures:**
   - Tokens should be cryptographically secure (use `random_bytes()`)
   - Tokens should be stored with a hash in the database
   - Tokens should be single-use (regenerate after each use)
   - HTTP-only cookies prevent JavaScript access

## Your Current Implementation:

In your `LoginController.php`, you already have:

```php
// Attempt login
$remember = isset($data['remember']) ? (bool)$data['remember'] : false;
$this->authService->login($data['username'], $data['password'], $remember);
```

And in your `SessionAuthenticationService`:

```php
public function login(string $username, string $password, bool $remember = false): bool
{
    // Authentication logic...
    
    if ($remember) {
        $this->createRememberMeToken($user);
    }
    
    return true;
}
```

## Testing the Remember Me Feature:

1. **Manual Testing:**
   - Log in and check "Remember Me"
   - Close your browser completely
   - Reopen browser and visit your site
   - You should still be logged in

2. **Cookie Inspection:**
   - After login with "Remember Me", check your browser cookies
   - You should see a cookie named something like "remember_token"
   - This cookie should have a long expiration date

3. **Database Verification:**
   - Check your `remember_tokens` table
   - You should see an entry with your user ID and token hash

4. **Security Testing:**
   - Try manipulating the cookie value - should invalidate the token
   - Check if tokens expire properly after their configured lifetime

If the "Remember Me" feature isn't fully implemented yet, you'll need to:

1. Create a `remember_tokens` table in your database
2. Implement token generation and storage in your auth service
3. Add cookie handling for the remember token
4. Implement automatic login from the remember cookie
