# Future Brute Force Protection Enhancements

This document outlines potential improvements to our brute force protection system.


## Files to refresh one memmory // Important!!!
**Files used new/updated
- CreateLoginAttemptsTable.php           
- LoginAttempt.php                 
- LoginAttemptsRepositoryInterface.php
- LoginAttemptsRepository.php
- SessionAuthenticationService.php    
- dependencies.php                      
- AuthenticationServiceInterface.php 
- LoginController.php 

## Files that are placeholders with // TODO....
- Search for `// TODO, this is a Draft id-1234`
- 4 files
    - src\App\Features\Admin\loginattemptadmin.php
    - src\App\Features\Admin\LoginAttemptsController.php
    - src\App\Repository\LoginAttemptsRepository.php
    - src\App\Repository\LoginAttemptsRepositoryInterface.php
- This files might be in **wrong Namespace**

## Administrative Dashboard // TODO

**Current Status**: Not yet implemented

Adding an administrative interface would allow authorized staff to:
- View all failed login attempts across the system
- Search/filter attempts by username, IP, or date range
- Manually clear attempts for specific users (to help with support requests)
- Run manual cleanup of old records
- View statistics on login attempt patterns

## Advanced Security Features  // TODO

**Current Status**: Not yet implemented

1. **Progressive Delays**
   - Increase wait time between login attempts after failures
   - Makes automated attacks exponentially slower

2. **CAPTCHA Integration**
   - Add CAPTCHA after 2-3 failed attempts
   - Prevents automated attacks while still allowing legitimate users multiple tries

3. **Email Notifications**
   - Alert users when suspicious login activity is detected
   - Allow users to verify activity or secure their account

4. **Geographic Restrictions**
   - Flag or block login attempts from unusual locations
   - Allow users to whitelist their common locations

## Reporting and Analytics  // TODO

**Current Status**: Not yet implemented

1. **Security Dashboard**
   - Visual representation of login attempts
   - Trend analysis of attack patterns
   - Geographic mapping of attempt sources

2. **Threat Intelligence**
   - Integration with known malicious IP databases
   - Automatic blocking of known attack sources

3. **Audit Logging**
   - Enhanced logging of all authentication-related actions
   - Compliance with security best practices and regulations

## Implementation Plan

These enhancements can be prioritized based on:
1. Security impact
2. Development effort
3. User experience benefits

The administrative dashboard would be the most immediate valuable addition, providing visibility and control over the existing system.
