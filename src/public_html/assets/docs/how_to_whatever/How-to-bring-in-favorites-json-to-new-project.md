## How to bring in favorites json to new project
yes, it is project based

(.favories.js)
- **ENABLE**... We use **Favorites Extension by kdcro101** "Heart ICON"
- Get Backup Copy of favories.json: `d:\MyPhpBackups\.favorites.json`
- Copy it to root of project. In this one case to `mvclixo`: "d:\xampp\htdocs\my_projects\mvclixo\.favorites.json"
- Make sure to refreshed "Favoties" click icon.

### Source of Truth
- `d:\MyPhpBackups\.favorites.json`
- `d:\xampp\htdocs\my_projects\mvclixo\.favorites.json`


I use favotites as a way to have files persist across multiple projects in vs code.

It lets me create a link to them that I then have access to in current projects. So not need to go search for them.



### Files: All these are just shortcuts to files

- External Files
    - hosts
    - http-ssl.conf
    - http-vhosts.conf - create Virtuals hosts
    - http.conf
    - php.ini - I am always messing with XDEBUG
    - settings.json
    - .favorites.json
    - mvclixo.code-workspace
    - ConsoleHost_history.txt


- My Notes
    - notes.md
    - notes_laravel.md
    - settings.json - vs-code file, just a shortcut that saves me about 2 clicks

other crap
    - php_error_log - am alwas looking at it
