When you see me Sanitize, Validate make sure i am not mixing concerns.
if so please warn me if you see this.

This is a new framework being built from scratch.
I want things done correctly that follow best modern SOLID framework standards.
No hacks,
SOLID Principles, reuse code.
if a Service should be used, please suggest an idea.
if u know of a good pattern to use, please suggest it.

(SOLID Services) please append "Service" as in XxxxxService.
